            <h3>Here are some of my favourites:</h3>
                <dl>
                    <dt>- The Image Tag</dt>
                    <dd>This tag allows us to add an image to a HTML page and make it more visual instead of just plain boring text. The path or source of the image is written within the first (src) inverted quotes and a description of the image is written within the second (alt) inverted quotes. Written as: <strong>&lt;img src="" alt=""></strong></dd>

                    <dt>- The List Tag</dt>
                    <dd>The list tags help in creating lists that are ordered and numbered, unordered with bullet points, or descriptive lists with a title and description. Written as: <strong>(Ordered List) &lt;ol> &lt;/ol>, (Unordered List) &lt;ul> &lt;/ul> and (Descriptive List) &lt;dl> &lt;/dl></strong></dd>
                    
                    <dt>- The Link Tag</dt>
                    <dd>Adding a link to your HTML document is done using a link tag. This is useful when directing the user to another page for more information or helping them navigate within the pages among your website. This allows you to add more information in your website making it structured and easy to absorb the information you provide. Written as: <strong>&lt;a href="">&lt;/a></strong></dd>

                    <dt>- Line Break Tag</dt>
                    <dd>This tag enters a single line break in content/text when needed eg. in addresses and poems. Written as: <strong>&lt;br></strong><em> Note: This tag must not be used to create visual breaks for design.</em></dd>

                    <dt>- Horizontal Line Tag</dt>
                    <dd>The Horizontal Line Tag draws a line between content and allows the developer to separate entire themes within the webpage. You can see how this tag has been used on this page to separate the Copyright information in the footer, from the body of the webpage. Written as: <strong>&lt;hr></strong><br></dd>
