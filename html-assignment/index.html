            <!-- Quote -->
            <p>One of my favourite quotes is:</p>
            <blockquote>
                "Be formless, shapeless, like water..."
                <br><cite> - Bruce Lee, July 20<sup>th</sup>, 2016</cite>
            </blockquote>
            <!-- Last paragraph -->
            <p>
                This quote is inspirational as it inspires one to be moldable into whatever situation life throws at you. To be like water is to be in a state in which one is constantly <em>learning, changing </em> and <em>challenging</em> oneself. This way, I would grow up to be wise and stay relevant with the changing times, which is very important for me as a creative professional.
