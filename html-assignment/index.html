                I was born on the 12<sup>th</sup> of January, 1993. My intials are <abbr title="Sunit Jacob Joseph">SJJ</abbr> and I currently study Interactive Media Design at Algonquin College in Ottawa, Canada. I'm an art director by profession and I love taking photographs in my free time. Exploring Canada is something I'd love to do with my time here as I enjoy trekking and am a bit of a nature enthusiast.
                My hobbies include:
            </p>
                <dl>
                    <dt>- Photography</dt>
                    <dd>I love clicking pictures with my camera. I used to carry my DSLR with me everywhere, but lately, I find myself clicking more pictures with my cellphone because of how advanced technology has come in fitting powerful cameras in smaller form factors.</dd>
                    
                    <dt>- Travel</dt>
                    <dd>Traveling and exploring is another hobby of mine. Back in Bangalore, I used to ride on my motorcycle to hills nearby and climb all the way to the top. This was a way for me to de-stress as well as keep myself fit.</dd>
                    
                    <dt>- Music</dt>
                    <dd>Although I only play the guitar in a limited capacity, I always find the need to explore new music all the time. Learning about new and upcoming musicians, genres and music festivals are some of the things I love about music.</dd>

                <!-- Quote -->
                <p> One of my favourite quotes is: </p>
            <blockquote>
                "Be formless, shapeless, like water..."
                <br><cite> - Bruce Lee, July 20<sup>th</sup>, 2016</cite>
            </blockquote>
            <!-- Ending paragraph -->
            <p>
                This quote is inspirational as it inspires one to be moldable into whatever situation life throws at you. To be like water is to be in a state in which one is constantly <em>learning, changing </em> and <em>challenging</em> oneself. This way, I would grow up to be wise and stay relevant with the changing times, which is very important for me as a creative professional.
