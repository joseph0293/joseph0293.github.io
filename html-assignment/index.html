                I was born on the 12<sup>th</sup> of January, 1993. My intials are <abbr title="Sunit Jacob Joseph">SJJ</abbr> and I currently study Interactive Media Design at Algonquin College in Ottawa, Canada. I'm an art director by profession and I love taking photographs in my free time. Exploring Canada is something I'd love to do with my time here as I enjoy trekking and am a bit of a nature enthusiast.

                <!-- Quote -->
                <p> One of my favourite quotes is: </p>
            <blockquote>
                "Be formless, shapeless, like water..."
                <br><cite> - Bruce Lee, July 20<sup>th</sup>, 2016</cite>
            </blockquote>
            <!-- Ending paragraph -->
            <p>
                This quote is inspirational as it inspires one to be moldable into whatever situation life throws at you. To be like water is to be in a state in which one is constantly <em>learning, changing </em> and <em>challenging</em> oneself. This way, I would grow up to be wise and stay relevant with the changing times, which is very important for me as a creative professional.
