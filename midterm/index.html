                A rainbow-colored crustacean skitters along the ocean floor, adding a splash of brightness to the
                murky setting. The animal’s narrow, hard-shelled body sports orange, green, red, and blue hues.
                Known as the peacock mantis shrimp, this beautiful, seven-inch-long critter looks harmless. But the
                marine animal packs a punch—literally.
            </p>
            <p>
                Peacock mantis shrimp mostly live in shallow parts of the Indian and Pacific Oceans. The crustacean
                spends much of its time looking for crabs and mollusks to eat. When it finds a delicious-looking
                snack, the animal goes into full-on boxer mode. Springing out one of its club-like front claws, the
                animal delivers a swift punch to its prey. The punch is 50 times faster than the blink of an eye and
                strong enough to break glass!
            </p>
            <p>
                These shrimp also rely on their sparing moves to keep enemies away from burrows in the ocean floor
                that they use as shelters. Hovering at the opening of its burrow, a peacock mantis shrimp will
                strike at intruders that come too close.
            </p>
            <p>
                The crustacean has another eye-popping feature in addition to its strong punch. Its eyes—which
                protrude from its head and move independently—can see in two different directions at once. They can
                also detect colors that humans are unable to see. It's easy to be floored by this animal's cool
                traits!

            <h3>
                Facts about The Mantis Shrimp
            </h3>
            <ul>
                <li>All mantis shrimp species can be divided into ‘spearers’ or ‘smashers’, based on the types of
                    claws they have and tactics they use to kill the prey.</li>
                <li>Smashers can punch at same velocity as a gunshot from a .22 caliber rifle.</li>
                <li>Their punch is so fast it results in ‘cavitation’ bubbles. This is a super heated bubble and
                    small flash of light, which for split seconds also generates temperates of 4,400&#8451; (which is
                    nearly as hot as the sun) in the surrounding water.</li>
                <li>They can crack and punch holes in aquarium glass.</li>
                <li>Their clubs have a special shock absorbent core which stops them from breaking.</li>
            </ul>
